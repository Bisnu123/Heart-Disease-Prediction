# Heart Disease Prediction
“A machine learning project that predicts heart disease using patient medical data. It compares multiple models and visualizes their accuracy for easy interpretation.”


## Overview
Predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient medical data. Multiple machine learning models are compared, and their performance is visualized for easy interpretation.

## Dataset
Patient medical features such as age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.  
**Target:** Heart Disease (Yes/No)  
**Source:** [Kaggle/UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## Features
- Data colllection, preprocessing & encoding,Model selection
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN
- Accuracy comparison & visualization

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb
